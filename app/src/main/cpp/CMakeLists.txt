# You can define multiple libraries, and CMake builds them for you.
# Gradle automatically packages shared libraries with your APK.

# Searches for a specified prebuilt library and stores the path as a
# variable. Because CMake includes system libraries in the search path by
# default, you only need to specify the name of the public NDK library
# you want to add. CMake verifies that the library exists before
# completing its build.
